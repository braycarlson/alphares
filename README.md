## alphares
alphares is a tool for Windows to save custom settings in Fortnite.

I made this tool when it was possible to customize Fortnite's resolution via a configuration file, however, Fortnite changed that sometime after the release of this project. As of late, I have noticed alphares appearing in YouTube and TikTok videos, so it might be possible to change the resolution of Fortnite again, but I am unable confirm it, as I no longer play the game. If you want to download this tool, then please do so from [here](https://github.com/braycarlson/alphares/releases/tag/1.2.1) as it is the safest option.

## Note
* You must have launched Fortnite at least once, and allowed the game to detect the best settings or saved custom settings in-game before running alphares.
* alphares can set/unset the read-only attribute for the Fortnite configuration file. It is set by default, however, you will not be allowed to make changes to settings in-game while it is set. If it is unset, Fortnite **might** overwrite your custom settings when you update the game.
* You must set the FPS field to `0` in alphares, if you want to have a **Unlimited** framerate in Fortnite.

## To-do
* Draw an outline on the `Apply` button when focused
* Customize and change the color of the `BS_GROUPBOX` rectangle
* Redraw the radio buttons
